## Assignment is to create a model to predict hospitalization in a 30 day window from some prior data. Our class was split into 2 groups to do different parts of the study. 
## Group A selected inclusion/exclusion criteria and other cohort selection
## Group B selected variables for use in the data to be used for training and testing. Then the data was formatted to make it amenable to creating the prediction model.
